/**
 * A library for generating particular forms of a given lexeme. All
 * conjugating / declining for Elementa is done in this library. Additionally,
 * Words are abstracted as serializable objects independent of the
 * strings given by the user enabling words to be saved and then loaded again
 * with different alphabet preverences (e.g. using 'i' for 'j', turning
 * macrons on / off).
