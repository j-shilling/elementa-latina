<h1>Elementa Latina</h1>

<p>Elementa Latina is meant to serve as a resource for Latin classrooms and to replace a 
few existing websites: <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">BlackBoard</a>, <a href="http://latin.ucant.org/">
Whitaker's Words</a>, and <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">The Perseus Projects</a>.
We hope to accomplish the same tasks which these sites propose to, but to do so with more
elegance and with a modern design.</p>

<h2 id="01">Elementa Latina 0.1</h2>

<p>The first release of Elementa Latina will be a simple online dictionary. Unlike virtually
all current online dictionaries, we will produce a monolingual dictionary, with optional
English translations, geared to show people how to use words actively and not simply to 
passively translate--a version of the <a href="http://linguax.com/lexica/forc.php">Totius
Lexicon Latinitatis</a> truly for the 21st century.</p>

<p>The initial release, therefore, needs first to maintain a database of users and authenticate
logins. It should also recognize 3 user roles: students, teachers, and administrators.
With respect to the dictionary interface, only the administrators should be able to edit
the dictionary on the site. Additionally both admins and teachers need to be able to create
other users accounts, but while teachers can only create student accounts, admins can
create and edit accounts of any time.</p>

<p>Users need to be able to edit their own account preferences. In the initial release the
available customizations will relate primarily to how the dictionary is presented to them:</p>

<table id="prefs">

	<tr>
		<th>option</th>
		<th>description</th>
		<th>default</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Interface Language</td>
		<td>Users should be able to view the website in at least English and Latin</td>
		<td>English</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>display macrons</td>
		<td>Some people like to see macrons used over long vowels, while some do not.
		Regardless of whether a long and short vowels are displayed differently, the application
		needs to recognize in its representation of a word the length of each vowel</td>
		<td>true</td>
	<tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>display diaeresis</td>
		<td>There are rare occasions where letters which would normally be pronounced
		as one syllable are separated into to. A diaeresis over the second letter is
		used to represent this.</td>
		<td>true</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>use 'j'</td>
		<td>Some books like to use a j to represent the consonant version of an i, others
		like to make Latin pointlessly harder to read.</td>
		<td>false</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>use 'v'</td>
		<td>Some books like to use a v to represent the consonant version of a u, others
		like to make Latin pointlessly harder to read.</td>
		<td>true</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>word click event</td>
		<td>Whenever any Latin text is displayed a user should be able to click on a word
		they do not know. When they make such a click, they may want to go to the full
		dictionary page, or simply to see an English translation of the word, and possible
		to see a Latin synonym of the word. These options should all be available.</td>
		<td>show English translation</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>search dictionary event</td>
		<td>Just as users can configure what they see when they click on a word, they should
		be able to customize the experience of searching the database. Our dictionary will story
		English translations, Latin synonyms, Latin definitions, and example sentences for each
		word. A user should be able to request that any of this information be shown or hidden</td>
		<td>show all</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p>Administrative accounts need to be able to maintain the site's dictionary. To do this they
need to create, edit and delete words from the lexicon. When an admin creates a word all regular,
inflected forms should be added automatically, but the user needs to be able to change to any 
robot-generated information. Creating high-quality monolingual definitions will be very time consuming 
and so admins should be able to save incomplete entries; however, this also requires that they have easy
access to the status of all dictionary entries to see what is and isn't finished</p>

<p>Anyone--whether logged in or not--should be able to search the dictionary. When a non-logged in
user searches the dictionary, default preferences should be used. When a user types in a Latin word
information for all possible lexemes which that word can be derived from will be returned. (E.g. 'amicis'
is could be a form of either 'amicus' or 'amica' and therefore both definitions should be returned.)
Additionally, the dictionary should be aware of alternative spellings of word (E.g. if 'lacryma' is
searched the standared spelling 'lacrima' will be returned.)</p>

<p>When a user is reading a Latin definition of a word, they should be able to click on any of the words
used in that definition and get the information specified in their user preferences for the clicked word</p>

<p>The option should also be available to search English translations of Latin words. If the dictionary
is set in English-Latin mode, typing in an English will return all word for which that is a stored translation
(E.g. typing in 'for' will return 'enim', 'pro', etc.).</p>
