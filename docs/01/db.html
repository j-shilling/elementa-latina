This release uses SQL databases. Local testing is done with MySQL, production with Google Datastore.</p>

<h2>User Accounts</h2>

<h3 id="users">Users Table</h3>

<p>Stores the main user account information</p>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>UID</td>
		<td>Int</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, AUTO_INCREMENT</td>
		<td>An integer unique to each user. Because users can change their username,
		this number is the only <i>guaranteed</i> way of identifying a specific
		user account. This is the primary key of the table.</td>
	<tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Username</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(25)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, UNIQUE</td>
		<td>A username for this account. The name must be unque in the DB, but can
		be changed by the user at any time. This is not a <i>guaranteed</i> way of 
		identifying a specific user account, because the value my be changed by
		the user in between queries</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(300)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The hash of a user's password. This value is only used to authenticate
		users at login</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Credentials</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(300)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, UNIQUE</td>
		<td>A hashed string a little less secure than the user's password used for
		authenticating logged in users. Because RESTful servers are stateless, the

		and Teacher account. 6 = 2 + 4 = Student and Teacher account).
	</td>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Account Preferences</td>
		<td>BLOB</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>A POJO representing the preferences of the user.</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<h3 id="usrrel">Account Relationships</h3>

<p>Future releases will rely heavily on the association between student accounts and the teacher
accounts associated with them; however, this release will need to lay the foundation for that in
its database structure. Moreover, knowing what teacher accounts govern a particular student account
will be important when it comes to the account administration pages of the 0.1 release. These
relationships are stored in their own table.</p>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY</td>
		<td>This is a number only used as the primary key of this table.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Parent</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UID)</td>
		<td>The UID of the user account which governs the other</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Child</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UID)</td>
		<td>The UID of the user account which is governed by the other</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p>Whenever a user account is created a corresponding relationship must also be added where the new
account is a child of the creating account. When an account is deleted, all of their relationships
should also be deleted. Student accounts should be deleted automatically if they are no longer the 
child of any other account. If a teacher account queries the database, results should be filtered to
exclude any account that is not a child of their account.</p>

<h2>Dictionary</h2>

<h3 id="words">Words</h3>

<p>All word forms of a given lexeme will be saved in their own database.</p>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Word ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY</td>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Lexeme ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>An identifier of a particular lexeme. All words which share
		a lexeme id are different forms of the same lexeme.</td>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Text</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The text representing a given word. All macrons and other accent
		marks should be removed and all 'j's and 'v's should be converted to 'i's
		and 'u's. This allows use to match a word even if the user uses different
		spelling conventions. String should be covernted to all lowercase chars</td>
	</tr>
		
	<tr>
		<td>Form</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>An integer which uniquely identifies a particular word form</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Word</td>
		<td>BLOB</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>A POJO representing the word.</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<p>There should be no two rows for which Lexeme ID, Text, and Form are all the same.</p>

<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>

<p>Our dictionary thinks of definitions as a collection of uses that a word can have. When a
word is searched for in the dictionary all associated uses will be returned. These uses need
to be stored as separate entities for future releases.</p>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Use ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY</td>
		<td>A primary key for the database.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Lexeme ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The lexeme this use is associated with</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Use</td>
		<td>BLOB</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The POJO representing the Latin definition of the word.</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<p>Example sentences, Latin synonyms, and English translations will be stored in separate tables.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Translations for each use are kept in a separate table</p>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Use ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, FORIEGN KEY REFERENCES Uses(Use ID)</td>
		<td>Connections this entity to its corresponding use</td>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Lexeme ID</td>

		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The lexeme this translation is associated with</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Translation</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The test of the English translation.</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<h3 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h3>

<p>Synonyms for each use are kept in a separate table</p>

	<tr>
		<td>Synonymous Lexeme ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The lexeme id of the synonym</td>
	</tr>
	
</table>

<h3">Example Sentences</h3>

<p>Example sentences should be kept for each use of each word. These examples will ideally
be drawn from authentic Latin texts and should therefore be connected in future releases with
the site-wide library. Because of this, the databases for storing and associated texts should
be implemented in this release. For every selection of text we want to use, there must be information
about the work it comes from and the works author.</p>

<h4 id="authors">Authors</h4>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Author ID</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY</td>
		<td>A primary key for the database.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>English Name</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The English name of the author, in all lowercase chars</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Latin Name Text</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The text of the Latin name in all lowercase with no accent marks.
		all 'j's and 'v' replaced with 'i's and 'u's.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Latin Name</td>
		<td>BLOB</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>A POJO representing the Latin name of the author</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>abbreviated Name</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(10)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL, UNIQUE</td>
		<td>The standard way of abbreviating the authors name in a citation</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>birth year</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NULL</td>
		<td>The year the author was born if known. Positive numbers represent C.E. years
		and negative numbers represent B.C.E years</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>death year</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NULL</td>
		<td>The year the author died if known. Positive numbers represent C.E. years
		and negative numbers represent B.C.E years</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p>If both the birth year and death year of an author are non-null, these dates are treated
as known dates. If one is non-null, then that is treated as an approximate year of the author's
life. (I.e. it will be presented to the use as 'Fl. 123 b.c.e.'). These columns are here for
later releases which will need to sort authors chronologically.</p>

<h4 id="works">Works</h4>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Options</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Latin Title Text</td>
		<td>VARCHAR(30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The text of the Latin title in all lowercase with no accent marks.
		all 'j's and 'v' replaced with 'i's and 'u's.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Latin Title</td>
		<td>BLOB</td>

		<td>A POJO representing the work's Latin title</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Year Written Earliest</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NULL</td>
		<td>The earliest year the work may have been written if known. Positive 
		numbers represent C.E. years and negative numbers represent B.C.E years</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Year Written Range Latest</td>
		<td>INT</td>
		<td>NULL</td>
		<td>The latest year the work may have been written if known. Positive 
		numbers represent C.E. years and negative numbers represent B.C.E years</td>
	</tr>
		
</table>

<p>If both Year Written Earliest and Year Written Latest have non-null values. These values
are treated as the range in which the work may have been written. If only one of these columns
has a non-null value, that value is treated as the exact year the work was written. These
columns are here for future releases.</p>

<h4 id="texts">Texts</h4>

<p>The actual text of a Latin work must be saved in small chunks to account for the likelihood
that an incomplete work will need to be saved or that a work may be added to the database
out of order. These will also be important for future releases when teachers will need to work
with only specific sections of a text. These checks, therefore, will need to have information
about their order within a work in an intuitive format compatible with the standard ways of 
citing sections of a Latin text.</p>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Row</th>

		<td>The Work Id of the work this text is a part of</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Location</td>
		<td>VARCHAR (30)</td>
		<td>NOT NULL</td>
		<td>The location of the text will be represented as a string of
		numbers separated by '.'s or ':'s. If we want to save the 4th sentence of
		the 1st paragraph of the 2nd Philipic the location would be "2.1.4".
		It should be up to the user's discretion as too how specific to make
		these chunks and so from the DB's point of view this string can be
		arbitrarily long and as short as one single number. When searching
		for a text by its location, we should return all sub-chunks of a given
		chunk. (e.g. search "1.2 will return any location 1.2.*"). If a location
		string is exactly one section more specific than any the closest saved
		location, the right most number will represent a work within the saved text.
		(E.g. if the DB contains only locations 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3 and the user
		searches for 1.2.2.5, this should be interpreted as wanted the 5th word of
		1.2.2; however, if the user searches for 1.2.2.5.1, this location is invalid.)</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
